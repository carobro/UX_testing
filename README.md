# Documentation for Usability Testing

## Definition of Usability
- Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use.
- The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.
Usability is defined by 5 quality components:
- *Learnability*: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
- *Efficiency*: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- *Memorability*: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
- *Errors*: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
- *Satisfaction*: How pleasant is it to use the design?

*Utility* = Whether it provides the features you need.
*Usability* = How easy & pleasant these features are to use.
*Useful = Usability + Utility* 

Main question is: **Does it do what users need?**

## Why Usability Is Important
- If a website is difficult to use or users get lost, ... 
- If a website fails to clearly state what it offers or what users can do on the site, ...
- If a website's information is hard to read or doesn't answer users' key questions, ...
... they leave.

- They will not start a website manual or otherwise spending much time trying to figure out an interface.
- **If a user cannot find what he is looking for, they cannot/will not use it.**

## How to Improve Usability**
- Get hold of some representative users.
- Ask the users to perform representative tasks with the design.
- Observe what the users do, where they succeed, and where they have difficulties with the user interface.
- Shut up and let the users do the talking.
- It's important to test users individually and let them solve any problems on their own.
- If you help them or direct their attention to any particular part of the screen, you have contaminated the test results.
- To identify a design's most important usability problems, testing 5 users is typically enough.

## When to Work on Usability
- Before starting the new design, test the old design to identify the good parts that you should keep or emphasize, and the bad parts that give users trouble.
- Test competitors' designs to get cheap data on a range of alternative interfaces that have similar features to your own.
- Conduct a field study to see how users behave in their natural habitat.
- Inspect the design relative to established usability guidelines whether from your own earlier studies or published research.
- Once you decide on and implement the final design, test it again.
- Subtle usability problems always creep in during implementation.
- Don't defer user testing until you have a fully implemented design. If you do, it will be impossible to fix the vast majority of the critical usability problems that the test uncovers.
- Many of these problems are likely to be structural, and fixing them would require major rearchitecting.

## Where to Test
- What matters is that you get hold of real users and sit with them while they use the design.
- A notepad is the only equipment you need.
