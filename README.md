## Concept for User Testing

Questions to be answered/ adressed in the concept:

1) What type of product/software/tool should be testet?
2) When am I doing user tests (during, at benchmarks or at the end of development)?
3) Who is the user group (demographical, social, educational, gender, mixture)?
4) How large should be my test-user group?
5) What is the aim of the user testing?

results in:
--> What type of user test should I do?

Depending of the User-Test-Type:
1) How do I habe to formulate my questions?
2)  What rating scale type should I use (Likert Scale, School grades, Agree/Disagree, ...)?
3) What setting do I need (remote, w/o computer, paper, alone, group, observed)
4) How much time do i have to plan?
5) How can i analyse the resuls/extract necessary improvements?
