# Usability Testing Documentation

## Definition of Usability
Usability is a crucial quality attribute that evaluates the ease of use of user interfaces. It encompasses methods aimed at enhancing user experience during the design phase.

Usability comprises five key components:
- *Learnability*: How easily can users accomplish basic tasks when encountering the design for the first time?
- *Efficiency*: Once users are familiar with the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- *Memorability*: After a period of not using the design, how easily can users regain proficiency?
- *Errors*: How frequently do users make errors, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover?
- *Satisfaction*: How enjoyable is the experience of using the design?

*Utility* refers to whether the design provides the necessary features, while *usability* pertains to how easy and pleasant these features are to use. The combination of usability and utility defines usefulness.

The primary question to address is: **Does the design fulfill users' needs?**

## Importance of Usability
A website's usability significantly impacts user engagement:
- If navigation is complex or unclear,
- If the website fails to communicate its offerings effectively,
- If the information provided is difficult to access or understand,

...users are likely to leave. They won't invest time in deciphering a convoluted interface.

- **If users can't find what they're looking for, they won't engage with it.**

## Enhancing Usability
Improving usability involves several steps:
- Engage representative users.
- Have users perform typical tasks using the design.
- Observe user interactions, noting successes and difficulties.
- Allow users to navigate without interference.
- Testing should be conducted individually to ensure unbiased results.
- Identifying major usability issues typically requires testing with just five users.

Steve Jobs famously stated, "If a User is having a problem, it's our problem."

## Timing for Usability Work
Effective usability work should occur throughout the design process:
- Evaluate the existing design before initiating a new one.
- Assess competitors' designs for insights.
- Conduct field studies to observe natural user behavior.
- Compare the design against established usability guidelines.
- Test the final design iteration.
- Address usability issues promptly, as they often emerge during implementation.

## Testing Environment
The crucial aspect is to involve real users and observe their interactions directly. Minimal equipment, like a notepad, suffices for documentation.

## Recruitment Planning Guidelines
Effective recruitment is essential for successful usability testing:
- Understand your target users thoroughly.
- Look for individuals genuinely interested in your product.

### Managing Limited Resources
In situations with tight budgets and timelines:
- Prioritize usability aspects aligned with project goals.
- Employ lean methodologies like guerrilla testing for efficient insights.
- Utilize open-source tools such as Selenium and OpenSTA to minimize costs while conducting effective usability assessments.
