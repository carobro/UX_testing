# Test Types
## Tree Testing

Tree testing evaluates how easy a website is to navigate. Participants are asked to navigate to a specific page on a website using only page names in a menu.
1. Limit tasks to fewer than 10.
2. Define tasks targeting specific areas of website improvement.
3. Formulate tasks as realistic scenarios for typical users.
4. Avoid using exact page names to prevent participants from easily finding correct answers.

Results from tree testing typically yield success or failure percentages. Researchers categorize participant performance as follows:

- Direct success: Navigating to the correct page without issue.
- Indirect success: Arriving at the correct page after backtracking or detours.
- Indirect failure: Ending up at the wrong page after backtracking or detours.
- Direct failure: Navigating directly to the wrong page.

## First-Click Testing
First-click testing determines where users start specific tasks on a webpage. Participants click where they think they should go first to complete a given task.
1. Limit tasks to fewer than 10.
2. Define tasks targeting specific areas of website improvement.
3. Formulate tasks as realistic scenarios for typical users.
4. Provide an “I don’t know where to click” button to avoid random guesses. (First-click tests might also include a question asking why the participant clicked somewhere.)
